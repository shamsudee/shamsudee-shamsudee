     <p>
        A vehicle tracking system combines the use of automatic vehicle location in individual vehicles with software that collects these fleet data for a comprehensive picture of vehicle locations.

        Modern vehicle tracking systems commonly use GPS or GLONASS technology for locating the vehicle, but other types of automatic vehicle location technology can also be used.

        Vehicle information can be viewed on electronic maps via the Internet or specialized software. 

        Urban public transit authorities are an increasingly common user of vehicle tracking systems, particularly in large cities.

     </p>


     <p>
        Several types of vehicle tracking devices exist. Typically they are classified as "passive" and "active". "Passive" devices store GPS location, speed, heading and sometimes a trigger event such as key on/off, door open/closed. Once the vehicle returns to a predetermined point, the device is removed and the data downloaded to a computer for evaluation. Passive systems include auto download type that transfer data via wireless download. "Active" devices also collect the same information but usually transmit the data in near-real-time via cellular or satellite networks to a computer or data center for evaluation.

        Many modern vehicle tracking devices combine both active and passive tracking abilities: when a cellular network is available and a tracking device is connected it transmits data to a server; when a network is not available the device stores data in internal memory and will transmit stored data to the server later when the network becomes available again.
        
        Historically, vehicle tracking has been accomplished by installing a box into the vehicle, either self-powered with a battery or wired into the vehicle's power system. For detailed vehicle locating and tracking this is still the predominant method; however, many companies are increasingly interested in the emerging cell phone technologies that provide tracking of multiple entities, such as both a salesperson and their vehicle. These systems also offer tracking of calls, texts, web use and generally provide a wider range of options.

       <h2>SOME TYPES OF Tracking</h2>
     <p>

       1: GPS tracking unit: The device fits into the vehicle and captures the GPS location information apart from other vehicle information at regular intervals to a central server. 
       Other vehicle information can include fuel amount, engine temperature, altitude, reverse geocoding, door open/close, tire pressure, cut off fuel, turn off ignition, turn on headlight, turn on taillight, battery status, GSM area code/cell code decoded, number of GPS satellites in view, glass open/close, fuel amount, emergency button status, cumulative idling, computed odometer, engine RPM, throttle position, GPRS status and a lot more. 
       Capability of these devices actually decide th  e final capability of the whole tracking system; most vehicle tracking systems, in addition to providing the vehicle's location data, feature a wide range of communication ports that can be used to integrate other onboard systems, allowing to check their status and control or automate their operation.

       <p>
    
     2: GPS tracking server: The tracking server has three responsibilities: receiving data from the GPS tracking unit, securely storing it, and serving this information on demand to the user.
       </p>

       <p>

      3: User interface: The UI determines how one will be able to access information, view vehicle data, and elicit important details from it.

        Vehicle tracking systems are an integrated part of the "layered approach" to vehicle protection, recommended by the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) to prevent motor vehicle theft. This approach recommends four layers of security based on the risk factors pertaining to a specific vehicle. Vehicle Tracking Systems are one such layer and are described by the NICB as "very effective" in helping police recover stolen vehicles.

        Some vehicle tracking systems integrate several security systems, for example by sending an automatic alert to a phone or email if an alarm is triggered or the vehicle is moved without authorization, or when it leaves or enters a geofence.
        
        Other scenarios in which this technology is employed include:
     </p>

       <h2>SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM</h2>
     <p>
       . Stolen vehicle recovery: Both consumer and commercial vehicles can be outfitted with RF or GPS units to allow police to do tracking and recovery. 
        In the case of LoJack, the police can activate the tracking unit in the vehicle directly and follow tracking signals.

       . Asset tracking: Companies needing to track valuable assets for insurance or other monitoring purposes can now plot the real-time asset location on a map and closely monitor movement and operating status.

       . Field service management: Companies with a field service workforce for services such as repair or maintenance, must be able to plan field workers’ time, schedule subsequent customer visits and be able to operate these departments efficiently. 
       Vehicle tracking allows companies to quickly locate a field engineer and dispatch the closest one to meet a new customer request or provide site arrival information.

       . Field sales: Mobile sales professionals can access real-time locations. For example, in unfamiliar areas, they can locate themselves as well as customers and prospects, get driving directions and add nearby last-minute appointments to itineraries. Benefits include increased productivity, reduced driving time and increased time spent with customers and prospects.

       . Trailer tracking: Haulage and Logistics companies often operate lorries with detachable load carrying units.
        The part of the vehicle that drives the load is known as the cab and the load carrying unit is known as the trailer. 
        There are different types of trailer used for different applications, e.g., flat bed, refrigerated, curtain sider, box container.

       . Surveillance: A tracker may be placed on a vehicle to follow the vehicle's movements.

       . Transit tracking: temporary tracking of assets or cargoes from one point to another. Users will ensure that the assets do not stop on route or do a U-Turn in order to ensure the security of the assets.

       . Fuel Monitoring: monitor the fuel through tracking device (with help of fuel sensor connected to the device).

       . Distance Calculation: calculate the distance travelled by the fleet.
        OBD II – Plug and play interface which provides most engine diagnostics information.
        Vehicle tracking systems are widely used worldwide. Components come in various shapes and forms but most use GPS technology and GSM services. 
        Newer Vehicle tracking systems also use the latest NB-IoT technology that can provide low power consumption and optimized data transmission rates. 
        Additionally, these systems may also feature short range data communication systems such as WiFi. While most will offer real-time tracking, others record real time data and store it to be read, in a fashion similar to data loggers. 
        Systems like these track and record and allow reports after certain points have been solved
